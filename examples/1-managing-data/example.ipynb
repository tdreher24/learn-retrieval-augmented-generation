In the 1980s the church asked David to tear out the old vines, then he watched as the land lay fallow for close to two decades. When he finally got the chance to replant, he jumped. He'd tasted fruit from Cappella in the 70s. He knew what kind of wine it could make. But that first replant was ill-fated thanks to diseased rootstock, and once again he was ripping out vines. “It took us six years before we had a crop. We could have ignored it, pulled the vines out one by one as they collapsed. But then we'd have all these different ripening patterns, which would impact consistency. It was an easy decision.”\"},\n",

Notions of menthol, scorched rocks, mocha, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, and espresso are found in this terrific offering. It will be developed and forward upon release, but will last for 12-15 years.    Winemaker and part owner, John Kongsgaard, produces these wines in partnership with auctioneer, Fritz Hatton. They are all fashioned from fruit grown in the \"H Block\" of the Hudson Vineyard, the highest point on that large ranch. The vineyard is planted in white volcanic ash-dominated soils. The Cabernet Franc/Merlot blend is the Arietta and the Syrah/Merlot blend is named Variation One. These striking offerings have a European sensitivity for elegance, structure, and delineation, but are clearly products of California, as evidenced by their prodigious ripeness as well as intensity.

His objective and vision was to seek and nurture the concept that Tempranillo, when cultivated at high altitudes, low-cropped, and from old vines, produces extraordinarily rich, deeply colored, and profound wines. This, coupled with specific barrel treatment (with minor American oak influences) produces one of Rioja's most exciting new wines. Artadi is about purity of deeply extracted fruit with almost Burgundian textures, sheer power, complexity, and startling finesse! The results have have been astounding.\"},\n",

Anticipated maturity: now-2020. As I have written before, the only way readers are going to get any of this wine is to be on the mailing list or check out one of the few restaurants that receives an allocation. This is an amazing operation on the hillsides overlooking the huge Dominus/Napanook estate. A complex set of caves and a remarkable, nearly surreal chateau grace the property. Winemaker Helen Turley, working with her viticulturalist husband, John Wetlaufer, is fashioning some spectacular wines from these hillsides of volcanic ash and basalt. These are big, structured, potentially long-lived wines that will need some cellar time for those lucky enough to latch onto a few bottles.

Initially, the wine is quite generous and pleasant, with somewhat high-toned, red fruits underscored by dark feral and dried-herb notes, but the wine finishes with an edgy acidity and ferocious tannins that are reminiscent of the “Villero”. The complexity and structure of the 2013 “Garblet Sue” is a testament to the seriousness and potential longevity of this classically structured vintage.

       "  'notes': 'In this vintage, the expressions of the 3 different terroirs of Cheval Blanc stand out perfectly. Although rich and powerful at 14.4%  the early picking of the Merlot helped to preserve freshness, purity and tension. The slower ripening of the Cabernet helped the grapes to reach ideal phenolic maturity. This is reflected in the wines which have a remarkable tannic presence. This vintage combines freshness and complexity, power and precision, balance and density. Aromatic complexity dominates from the first nose and this wine expresses the elegance brought to it by optimal weather conditions. The significant proportion of Merlot brings particularly intense aromas of red and black fruit. The impressive nose is pure and precise with notes of raspberry, cherry, blackberry and blackcurrant embalmed in balsamic and subtle sweet aromas of pastries. The generosity and complexity of the nose dominate. Clean, pure and precise, this wine is lush and juicy reflecting perfectly the traits of the fresh fruit when it is tasted directly in the vineyard. A full, attractive attack is redolent of the Merlot of this vintage which is unctuous, round and mouth filling. The Cabernet Franc lends a lovely freshness to the mid-palate and gives the wine length on the finish. This wine is both dense and powerful whilst at the same time soft, unctuous and round. Depth, length and balance are the hallmarks of this vintage and form the identity of this wine.'},\n",

Although not always very outgoing in young vintages, it is marked by fruit (apricot, mandarin, and occasionally tropical fruit) and oak (vanilla and toasty aromas). Older vintages, on the other hand, have an extraordinarily complex fragrance as soon as the bottle is opened. The bouquet is amazingly subtle, with hints of dried fruit (dried apricot, prune, stewed fruit, and marmalade), spice (cinnamon, saffron, and licorice), and even flowers (linden blossom, etc.). The first impression on the palate is always very silky, and often sumptuous. It then fills out, \"coating the palate.\" This fine wine has a strong, but never overbearing character, with great elegance and poise. It always maintains a balance between sugar and acidity (sweetness and freshness).'},\n",

The 2005 will challenge the extraordinary 2000. Among the truly fabulous wines made here (i.e., 2000, 1990, 1989, 1985, and 1982), its deep ruby/purple hue is accompanied by an exquisite bouquet of incense, raspberry jam, kirsch, licorice, and hints of black olives as well as flowers. This broadly perfumed Pomerol exhibits sensational purity, sweet tannin, medium to full body, and outstanding elegance and finesse. The fruit is forward and precocious, but there is enough stuffing, structure, and density for the wine to evolve for 20-25 years.\"'},\n",

A combination of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, and 2% Petit Verdot, it represents a ripe version of the essence of Lafite-Rothschild. Dense purple-colored, with classic notes of graphite intertwined with melted licorice, creme de cassis, smoke, and flowers, it reveals extraordinary richness, opulence, power, purity, intensity, and viscosity. Whether this wine will close down or not is questionable as it is somewhat atypical given its sweetness and softness.

       "  'notes': '2015 was, literally, an historic year at Château Margaux. We celebrated the bicentenary of the Estate’s buildings dating from 1815, and the inauguration of the new facilities, designed or reorganised, by Norman Foster. It is easy to imagine how much we dreamed that 2015 would be a great vintage!

The grapes had rarely, perhaps never, been as concentrated, particularly the Cabernets. In certain cases we surpassed the already historic levels of the 1986 and 1995 vintages, with an elegance and softness on the palate, reminiscent also of the 1990 and 1996 vintages. It seemed in fact that 2000 was setting a new benchmark in quality, never before attained, at least in terms of style. Throughout the barrel ageing time, these first impressions were gradually confirmed. The wine has now acquired a slightly tighter texture and at the same time keeps such a soft and especially long finish that it seems to go on forever… The bottling took place in November 2002, after over 2 years of barrel ageing. Such a long ageing is unusual but not as rare as one might think: most of the greatest vintages are aged for that length of time. (May 2010)'},\n",

The color is a deep and dense purple, with violet highlights which underscore the wine's youth. Its clean aromas highlight good intensity and well-defined fruitiness. Black currants, blueberries and assorted black fruit are present, together with flattering chocolate and spicy notes derived from careful aging in barrel. The first impression on the palate is faultless, and the quality of the vintage becomes evident as its taste evolves. The wine shows a full body, both tight and supple at once. Everything comes together to create an exemplary balance. The tannins are fine-grained, with a structure which ensures a long and brilliant future. The wine's class and nobility express the care taken during vinification to respect the vintage's potential. The finish is mouth-watering and long, worthy of a great Saint-Emilion.  \"},\n",

It is one of the best-known St. Emilions, vinified in a slightly lighter, more elegant style. With moderate red currant fruit in the nose, plus earth and spice, it can be peppery, spicy, or even leafy with hints of red cherries. Like other wineries in the côtes of St. Emilion, Chateau Pavie makes firm wines that are restrained and austere when young. The occasionally severe tannins mature with age into a fine sinewy structure. The better vintages are deep, intense, and concentrated. They mature 7-20 years after the vintage.\"},\n",

There is a well-developed and complex aromatic palette of chocolate, cacao, and black currant that is typical in wines touched by the sun, joined by an attractive spiciness. Supporting all this is a balanced woody character which is elegant and striking. The wine is somewhat paradoxical: it has an aromatic style reminiscent of those from the south of France; but the palate is surprisingly different, with still-developing, tight tannins, and the particularly dense and elegant body characteristic of a mature Bordeaux harvest. The long finish shows very good balance. This is a wine for long keeping which will develop fully only after five to 12 more years. Winter foods like tasty game dishes will perfectly accompany this wine at table.  \"},\n",

The Garnacha wines are 80+ years of age while the other varieties (Carinena, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah) have been planted since the early 1980s. Average yields are under 10 hectoliters per hectare and only 2000 cases are produced. The winery has never purchased outside fruit. The wine is deep purple-colored with a superb bouquet of toasty oak, pencil lead, mineral, blackberry and black cherry. This leads to an opulent, dense, packed, structured wine with 6-8 years of aging potential. Super-concentrated, sweetly-fruited, and complex, this tour de force of a wine will drink well from 2012 to 2040.\"'},\n",

The idea of a Tokay developed during vintage 2002 when cousin Jeff asked if I could make him a barrel of Tokay for him to stow away in his shed. There was one remaining row of old Tokay in the vineyard and it\\'s days looked to be numbered. This Tokay had recently been used for a local winemaker\\'s sparkling wine base and was no longer required. The plan was to make a barrel of fortified Tokay for the shed and after vintage knock the vines out with the bulldozer. I struck a deal with Jeff, agreeing that if the wine shaped up well that maybe we would get to keep the vines.   We produced 4 hogsheads and the wine was great, and as a result the vines are now here to stay. 2 barrels of Tokay are in Jeff\\'s shed and I got to take the rest. '},\n",

       "  'notes': 'Aromatic waves of black cherry, pomegranate, and boysenberry fill the glass of this elegantly concentrated wine. Subtle notes of anise, black tea leaves, and redwood needles add further depth and complexity to the nose. The weight and concentration of this heady wine is immediately apparent in the mouth, with dense layers of black fruit, pencil shavings, and hints of cocoa. The velvet-like tannins provide structure that is punctuated by a refreshingly acidic finish that lingers in the mouth for several minutes. This wine will age gracefully for a full decade or more.

       "  'notes': 'It presents itself in the glass with a glowing golden hue, highlighted by extremely fine, persistent bubbles. The bouquet displays an incredible succession of sensations that continue to alternate, ranging from citrus zest to creamy eggnog, from mango to sugared almonds, and from acacia blossom to freshly baked brioche, all underpinned by an enticing hint of iodine. The entry on the palate is sumptuous in its unbridled elegance and light in its incredibly concentrated fruitiness, which offers reminiscences of ripe pineapple, dried fruits and toasted hazelnuts. The finish is very refined, revealing lingering brackish notes that give even greater length to the aftertaste.'},\n",

Though the \"second wine\" of Ferrer Bobet, the initial 2005 release put Ferrer Bobet on the wine world map. It launched the Ferrer Bobet mission of creating wines of elegance and purity, and the message has resonated.'},\n",
